1. Stem length (m); data taken from specimen labels. (stemlength)
2. Stem diameter (cm); data taken from specimens, with sheaths. (stemdiameter)
3. Petiole length (cm); data taken from specimens or specimen labels. (petiole)
4. Rachis length (cm); data taken from specimens or specimen labels, not including cirrus on cirrate leaves. (rachislen)
5. Number of pinnae per side of rachis; data taken from specimens or specimen labels. (numpin)
6. Middle pinna length (cm); data taken from specimens. (pinlength)
7. Middle pinna width at mid-point (cm); data taken from specimens. (pinwidth)
8. Distal pair of pinnae joined at their bases (cm); data taken from specimens. (apjoin)
9. Staminate inflorescence length (cm); data taken from specimens or specimen labels. (stinflolen)
10. Staminate rachilla length, proximalmost one (cm); data taken from specimens. (straclen)
11. Pistillate inflorescence length (cm); data taken from specimens or specimen labels. (pisinflolen)
12. Pistillate rachilla length, proximalmost one (cm); data taken from specimens. (psraclen)
13. Fruit length (mm); data taken from specimens and includes persistent perianth. (fruitlen). Fruit length includes the fruiting perianth (and for this reason fruit length often appears longer than width in fruits scored as globose).
14. Fruit diameter (mm); data taken from specimens. (fruitdiam)
